Project: Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression
About Me
Hello! I am Shreyash Upadhyay, a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE Core) at Galgotias University. I am passionate about machine learning, data science, and developing solutions to real-world problems through technology. My interests lie in applying data-driven approaches to solve complex problems, particularly using statistical models and machine learning algorithms.

****Project Overview---------
This project implements Linear Regression to predict housing prices based on key features such as:

Square footage
Number of bedrooms
Location
The model is trained on the Boston Housing Dataset, which contains various features of houses in Boston and their corresponding prices. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the housing price given the input features.

****Contributions------------

Data Preprocessing: I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and scaling features to ensure that the model performs efficiently.
Feature Selection: Key features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location were selected to train the model, based on their correlation with housing prices.
Model Implementation: I implemented the linear regression model from scratch using Python and scikit-learn. The model was trained and evaluated on the Boston Housing Dataset to predict housing prices.
Model Evaluation: I assessed the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to gauge accuracy and effectiveness.
Visualization: I visualized the relationships between the selected features and housing prices to provide insights into the data using tools like matplotlib and seaborn.
****Technologies Used---------

Python
scikit-learn for machine learning
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
